## 📥 Installation

### Windows

1. **Download** the latest release:
   - Go to [Releases](https://github.com/jessica-le/buggy/releases/latest)
   - Download `Buggy-Windows.zip`

2. **Extract** the ZIP file to a folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Buggy\`)

3. **Run** `Buggy.exe`

4. **Optional:** Right-click `Buggy.exe` → "Pin to taskbar" for easy access

**Note:** Windows may show a security warning the first time. Click "More info" → "Run anyway" (the app is safe, just not signed).

### macOS

1. **Download** the appropriate version:
   - **Intel Macs:** Download `Buggy-macOS-Intel.zip`
   - **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3):** Download `Buggy-macOS-AppleSilicon.zip`
   - Get them from [Releases](https://github.com/jessica-le/buggy/releases/latest)

2. **Extract** the ZIP file

3. **Move** `Buggy.app` to your Applications folder

4. **First launch:**
   - Right-click `Buggy.app` → "Open"
   - Click "Open" in the security dialog
   - (This is required for unsigned apps - only needed the first time!)

5. **Optional:** Drag to Dock for easy access

**Note:** The app is unsigned, so you need to right-click → Open the first time. After that, you can double-click normally.

## 🚀 Usage

### Starting a Focus Session

1. **Enter your task** - What are you actually working on?
2. **Choose duration** - 5m, 15m, 25m, 45m, 60m, or custom
3. **Select blocking mode:**
   - **😤 Gentle** - Nags you with notifications when you get distracted
   - **🔒 Hard** - Actually blocks sites and apps (requires admin on Windows)
4. **Add sites/apps to block** - Click preset buttons or add custom ones
5. **Click "Start Session"**

### Flow Mode

Click the **∞ flow** button for open-ended sessions. Perfect for when you don't know how long you'll work. No blocking, just a companion to keep you company.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Enter** - Start session
- **ESC** - Close launcher or minimize timer overlay

## 🎨 Themes

Switch between themes in the launcher:
- 🌲 **Forest** - Mossy greens and warm cream
- 💙 **Baby Blue** - Soft sky and cotton whites
- 🏁 **Gingham** - Classic red check pattern

## 💡 Tips

- **Hard mode on Windows** requires running as administrator to modify the hosts file
- **Stats are saved locally** and won't be lost when you close the app
- **Minimize the overlay** - Click the minimize button to hide the timer while keeping the session active
- **Extend sessions** - When time's up, you can extend by 10 or 25 minutes

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Windows
- **App won't start:** Make sure you extracted the entire folder, not just the .exe
- **Icon missing:** The icon is embedded - if it shows as blank, try unpinning and re-pinning
- **Hard mode doesn't work:** Run as administrator (right-click Buggy.exe → Run as administrator)

### macOS
- **"App is damaged" error:** Right-click → Open instead of double-clicking
- **App crashes on wake:** This should be fixed in v1.0.0+
- **Permission issues:** Go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy and allow the app
